# DNA_2_UI

Idea is to display DNA in form that is more human readable.
Just having fun with publicly avaible sequences.

DnaPathDrawer display DNA as path, draw line wiht turning when A,T,C,G 
            'A' turn 0
            'T' turn 45
            'C' turn 90
            'G' turn 180

sample path for //TP53_dna = "ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCC...";
