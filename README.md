# DNA_2_UI

Idea is to display DNA in form that is more human readable.
Just having fun with publicly avaible sequences.
* code was generated via copilot
* DnaPathDrawer
  display DNA as path, draw line wiht turning when A,T,C,G 
            'A' turn 0
            'T' turn 45
            'C' turn 90
            'G' turn 180

sample path for //TP53_dna = "ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCC...";

* CodonToBase64
there are 64 codons so base64 looks as natural idea
  Example Mapping
  
Codon	Index	Base64

AAA	0	A

AAC	1	B

AAG	2	C

AAU	3	D

...	...	...

UUU	63	/
