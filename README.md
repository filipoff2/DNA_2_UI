# DNA_2_UI

Idea is to display DNA in form that is more human readable.
Just having fun with publicly avaible sequences.
* code was generated via copilot
* DnaPathDrawer
  display DNA as path, draw line wiht turning when A,T,C,G 
            'A' turn 0
            'T' turn 45
            'C' turn 90
            'G' turn 180

sample path for //TP53_dna = "ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCCC...";
